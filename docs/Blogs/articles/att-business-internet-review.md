AT&T Business pros and cons
---------------------------

If your workplace needs performance and speed, AT&T Business more than delivers—just be prepared to possibly pay more than you might be comfortable with.

Telecom giant AT&T has an internet, phone, and TV plan for almost every business, if not necessarily every budget. Even its lower-tier business plans are on the pricey side, and AT&T’s deluxe fiber-optic internet package could set you back as much as $500 a month.



|*Pros*|*Cons*|

AT&T Business uses several delivery models to get the job done. Its internet services are delivered through either phone-line DSL or newer fiber-optic cables (depending on the area), the phone services are a mix of those same lines. Also, its television service comes from DIRECTV (just one of the 98 media and telecom brands that AT&T owns).

### AT&T Business Internet

| **Our Pick**|  Price| Standout Features|

| **Business Fiber 100**      | $140/mo. | Download speeds up to 100 Mbps |



_Data effective 06/09/2020. Offers and availability may vary by location and are subject to change._

If you’re in an area serviced by AT&T Business Fiber, we recommend the Business Fiber 100 plan. Its mid-level speed rate and price tag work well for a small- to medium-sized business on a budget.

We’d suggest larger businesses with fewer budget concerns go for the primo Business Fiber 1000—1 Gbps (1 gigabit per second, which is the same as 1,000 megabits per second, or Mbps) is fast, even for multi-user business use.

For those outside of fiber areas, we’d recommend the Internet 100 DSL plan. It’s $10 pricier ($150/mo. total) for the same 100 Mbps download speed, but it’ll still be worth it if your team does a lot of business online.

### AT&T Business TV

| **Our Pick**|  Price| Standout Features|
|:------------- |:-------------:|:-----|
| **Commercial XTRA Pack**      | $89.99/mo. | DIRECTV package w/ NFL SUNDAY TICKET |


_Data effective 6/9/2020. Offers and availability may vary by location and are subject to change._

AT&T owns DIRECTV, and AT&T’s Business TV packages are provided by the satellite TV company and split into two categories: 1) business place on-site viewing (for offices and shops) and 2) public viewing (for restaurants and bars). Both package categories are based on DTV’s residential XTRA, ENTERTAINMENT, and SELECT plans. They all require a two-year contract.

If you’re operating a sports bar/restaurant, we’d recommend the Commercial XTRA PACK to get all the games on all of your screens: DIRECTV is a sports must, mostly thanks to its exclusive NFL SUNDAY TICKET. 

### AT&T Business Phone

| **Our Pick**|  Price| Standout Features|
|:------------- |:-------------:|:-----|
| **Local Unlimited + Long Distance**      | $75/mo. | Digital VoIP phone|



AT&T Business Phone service is VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol), meaning the call travels over the internet rather than traditional phone lines—even though DSL internet and voice calls are carried simultaneously over those same phone lines. Yes, landline phone systems are complicated these days.

Fortunately, VoIP phone systems simplify things by making functionality fully digital. Call forwarding and waiting, voicemail, caller ID, speed dialing, and more office-phone necessities are all cloud-based (meaning no physical hardware cluttering the office).

A&T also has mobile Business Wireless plans available, of course, because it’s AT&T.

### AT&T Business Bundles


| **Our Pick**|  Price| Standout Features|
|:------------- |:-------------:|:-----|
| **Internet 100 + AT&T Phone**      | $135/mo. | 100 Mbps download speed Unlimited calling in US, Canada, and Mexico

At $135 a month, the Internet 100 + AT&T Phone plan should cover the needs of most businesses well. It gives you 100 Mbps of internet download speed (a good and scalable baseline speed for businesses) and unlimited calling across the US, Canada, and Mexico.

We didn’t include TV because AT&T doesn’t, really: there’s no discount on DIRECTV services when bundled. The same standalone DIRECTV price applies whether combined with other services or not, kind of defeating the point of a bundle.

AT&T Business fees and charges
------------------------------

AT&T Business gives you the option of setting up your own DSL internet connection for free, which basically entails plugging in a modem/router and configuring your own Wi-Fi settings. Some will say “cool, simple,” while others break out in a cold sweat just reading that—don’t worry, you can pay AT&T $200 to set it up if needed.

Even though it’s a more complicated process, AT&T will set up a fiber internet connection for just $99. The catch is there’s no do-it-yourself option—AT&T has to install the fiber hookup.

Early termination fees also apply differently to AT&T’s DSL and fiber plans. If you cancel a DSL connection before the 12-month contract is up, you’ll pay $20 per every month that was left in the agreement. AT&T fiber, on the other hand, requires no contract. We’d guess that AT&T expects you’ll be dazzled by fiber’s superior performance and it won’t need to lock you down.

AT&T Business contracts
-----------------------

In addition to having no contract, AT&T Business’s fiber internet plans come with a 24-month price guarantee. We like how AT&T is incentivizing a service that’s already hard to say no to (if you can get it, that is).

That contract-duration price also applies to AT&T Business’s DSL internet. As we mentioned above, that contract is for 12 months. Both DSL and fiber plans come with 30-day money-back guarantees.
